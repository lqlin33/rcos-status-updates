## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week I presented for the RCOS presentation, which went well. I also finished an admin response feature, which can be found under the admin-response branch off the master branch. This feature allows admins to look at all petitions and quickly see how many signatures the petition has and whether that petition has a response. Admins can also search for petitions by title. Clicking into the petition shows the petition details with certain fields like author and created date being read only and also allows the admin to create, edit, or delete a response to the petition. Achieving this required some changes in the petition model, so pushing this code would require making sure that those model changes don't break existing code.

Future developments with this tool are to be able to filter by whether the petition has a response or not, filter by whether a petition has reached the required number of signatures, tracking who makes what changes to any petition object, and requiring certain response fields if its corresponding checkmark is checked.

As for other contribution I've made this semester, the model unit tests I wrote can be found under the model-unittests branch off the master branch.
