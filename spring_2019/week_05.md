## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week I continued writing up more unit tests and started a new branch for the admin page response feature. I had planned on getting further (finishining unit tests, messing around the response feature), but I've been trying to get pipenv to work for me, as our team is switching from virtualenv to pipenv. Originally, I had gotten pipenv to work briefly, but for some reason, it's no longer working.

## This Week's Plan

This week I plan on fixing whatever is happening with pipenv, finish those unit tests, and start the admin page response feature.

## Anything Blocking?

Just the pipenv not working, but I will discuss this with my mentor to see if she has any insights.
