## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week I unfortunately only made small progress with the Django tutorial because my week was extremely busy with exams and other schoolwork.

## This Week's Plan

This week I plan to finally finish familiarizing myself with Django through the tutorial I'm currently working on and to look through the project's code to familiarize myself with what's already there, so I can plan what I want to work on to contribute to the project.


## Anything Blocking?

I just had a very busy week this past week, so I didn't get to work on this project much. Next week is much less stressful, so I should be able to make more progress.
