## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week I worked on getting the RCOS group presentation ready for this following Tuesday. I also continued tinkering with the admin response feature, getting the display of petition information a little clearer. However, I ran into trouble showing each petition's response and allowing it to be editable from the petition information. I anticipate that solving this problem may involve changing the petition models themselves.

## This Week's Plan

This week I plan to finish up the group presentation as well continuing to try to get the admin response feature to work by looking more into Django's inline feature and learning more about how to manage the different one-to-one vs. foreign key vs one-to-many relationships.

## Anything Blocking?

Looking more into how to manipulate admin list and detailed views.
