## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week I worked more on learning Django through tutorials and started writing up some unit tests for the petitions model.

## This Week's Plan

This week I plan on finish writing the unit tests, seeing if there's a way to check code coverage of the unit tests, and looking into having a response feature for the admin page.

## Anything Blocking?

Nope!
