## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week I implemented the changes to my pull request for the model unit tests, so all that needs to happen there is for branch to be approved to be merged in. I also started working on the admin response feature by creating dummy petitions through the admin page and writing code to display each petition's information properly.

## This Week's Plan

This week I plan to continue working on the response feature by adding a way to edit a petition's response when looking at the petition's own edit page as well as looking into how to restrict editing certain fields and logging editing changes. I also realized that I may have to make changes to the model as I go, so I will be doing that as well.

## Anything Blocking?

None currently.
