## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week I fixed the problem I was having with pipenv (I was a commit behind in another branch, which meant I was missing a crucial folder) and installed the Python Black formatter. I continued writing unit tests but am having trouble getting the unit tests for testing number of signatures and tags to work. It seems to do something with the initialization of the petitions model. I also created an issue that the petition model should require certain fields like title and expected number of signatures. Additionally, I looked into Django getter/setter practices and found some things on using Python's @property functionality.

## This Week's Plan

This week I plan on resolving the issues I've been having with developing the signature and tag unit tests and looking more into using @property for getters/setters.

## Anything Blocking?

As discussed above, the errors when developing signature and tag unit tests. I will research more and ask my mentor for advice.
