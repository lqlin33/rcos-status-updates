## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week I worked on finishing up the official Django tutorial and am feeling more comfortable with it. I also started looking through the project's code to familiarize myself with what's already there, especially now that the model is updated.

## This Week's Plan

This week I plan on looking into how to write unit tests and planning those out for the current model. 

## Anything Blocking?

Still getting used to the whole process (like learning what unit tests are), but my group is supportive.
