## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week I familiarized myself with Github and Django. Since I am entirely new to RCOS it's been a steep learning curve. I attended the Git workshop to get a better feel for how to use Git and Github, so I feel relatively comfortable in that area. I also started a Django tutorial suggested by the project's Wiki and have created a repository on my Github account tracking my progress with that.

## This Week's Plan

This week I plan to finish familiarizing myself with Django through the tutorial I'm currently working on as well as through other resources my group suggests. I also plan to look through the project's code to familiarize myself with what's already there, so I can think of what I want to work on to contribute to the project.


## Anything Blocking?

Being entirely new makes the learning process a bit overwhelming, but my group has been supportive with pointing me in the right direction and helping me out. With more time, I'll get more comfortable with the project and code.
