## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week I finished writing the unit tests for the current version of the model and submitted a pull request to merge my branch with the master branch, which is super exciting!

## This Week's Plan

This week I plan to start developing a response feature for the admin page. An issue has already been created for this, and I have been assigned to it. By the end of this week, I hope to have finished researching Django's documentation on developing admin features and implementing a backbone for admins to submit responses to petitions.

## Anything Blocking?

None currently.
